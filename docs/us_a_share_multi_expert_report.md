# U.S. Zero-Shot Multi-Expert Report

## Scope

This report is an internal research note summarizing the current end-to-end experiment set for `A股训练 -> 美股 zero-shot -> 白盒风控 -> Alpaca-style historical execution`.

The aligned comparison window used for the main cross-expert table is **2025-03-13 to 2025-12-23**. This window was chosen because it is the common overlap across the five single-expert zero-shot outputs used in the ensemble comparison, with `transformer` starting later than the others. Single experts were filtered to that common window so they can be compared with the 5-expert ensemble on the same date range.

Core datasets:

## Benchmark

The current `benchmark` is an **internal same-window, same-pool benchmark**, not `SPY` and not a tradable ETF baseline.

At the white-box risk layer, the benchmark return for each rebalance date is the mean forward return of the available pool on that date. The implementation is in [risk_pipeline.py](C:/Users/Apricity/Desktop/股票/risk_management/white_box/risk_pipeline.py): it computes `benchmark_realized = date_slice["realized_return"]` and then `benchmark_return = benchmark_realized.mean()`.

At the Alpaca-style execution layer, the backtest does not create a new benchmark; it reuses the `benchmark_return` path already written into `risk_periods.csv`. The implementation is in [backtest_alpaca_style.py](C:/Users/Apricity/Desktop/股票/execution/scripts/backtest_alpaca_style.py), where it loads `risk_periods.csv`, reads `benchmark_return`, and compounds it into `benchmark_total_return`.

This means the benchmark is best read as **“同窗同池内部参考线”**:
- same time window
- same candidate pool
- same rebalance rhythm

It also means `benchmark_total_return` is **not a universal market index benchmark**, so the cleanest cross-expert comparison right now is the combination of:
- aligned date window
- absolute execution return
- execution drawdown
- transaction cost

## Shared Setting

White-box risk parameters used in the aligned comparison:
- `top_k=5`
- `min_confidence=0.7`
- `min_close=5`
- `min_amount=100000000`
- `group_column=industry_group`, `max_per_group=1`
- `secondary_group_column=amount_bucket`, `secondary_max_per_group=2`
- `weighting=score_confidence`
- `max_position_weight=0.35`
- `transaction_cost_bps=10`

Alpaca-style execution replay settings:
- `default_account_equity=100000`
- `allow_fractional=true`
- `min_order_notional=50`
- `max_position_weight=0.35`
- `long_only=true`
- `order_type=market`
- `time_in_force=day`
- `cancel_open_orders_first=true`
- `order_sizing_mode=hybrid`
- `buying_power_buffer=0.97`
- `transaction_cost_bps=10`

`Tx Cost` in the tables below is reported in simulated account currency (`USD`), not in basis points. In the execution replay, each order cost is computed as `executed_notional * transaction_cost_bps / 10000`, then summed across executed orders. The implementation is in [backtest_alpaca_style.py](C:/Users/Apricity/Desktop/股票/execution/scripts/backtest_alpaca_style.py).

Key read:
- Best single-expert execution return on the aligned window is **transformer = 28.39%**.
- Strongest single-expert risk-layer return is `lstm = 470.02%`.
- Highest aligned zero-shot correlation among single experts is `xgboost = 0.1652`.

## Ensemble

The ensemble combiner is implemented in:
- [predict_ensemble.py](C:/Users/Apricity/Desktop/股票/model_prediction/ensemble/scripts/predict_ensemble.py)
- [train_ensemble.py](C:/Users/Apricity/Desktop/股票/model_prediction/ensemble/scripts/train_ensemble.py)
- [shared.py](C:/Users/Apricity/Desktop/股票/model_prediction/ensemble/shared.py)
- [expert_registry.py](C:/Users/Apricity/Desktop/股票/model_prediction/common/expert_registry.py)

Aligned ensemble results:

| Ensemble | Corr | Dir Acc | Risk Return | Risk Benchmark | Execution Return | Execution Benchmark | Excess | Max DD | Tx Cost (USD) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ensemble_mean_score | 0.0535 | 48.20% | 412.70% | 183.58% | 36.32% | 183.58% | -147.26% | -15.19% | 7435.86 |
| ensemble_rank_average | 0.0591 | 56.65% | 354.19% | 183.58% | 17.20% | 183.58% | -166.38% | -14.83% | 9492.18 |
| ensemble_vote | 0.0756 | 56.65% | 331.84% | 152.62% | 15.75% | 152.62% | -136.86% | -19.51% | 8358.80 |

Key read:
- Best ensemble execution return is **ensemble_mean_score = 36.32%**.
- On this aligned setting, `mean_score` beats the other ensemble methods at the execution layer.
- Even the best ensemble still trails the internal same-window benchmark, which reinforces that the main bottleneck is execution realism rather than pure signal generation.

## Limitations

- The benchmark used here is an internal same-window, same-pool reference, not an external market benchmark such as `SPY`.
- The aligned ranking table is based on one common overlap window only. It should not be read as a stable multi-window leaderboard.
- The report does not yet include a U.S.-trained in-domain control inside the same comparison table.
- Transaction costs are modeled as a simple proportional fee proxy, not a full broker fee + slippage + queue-position decomposition.

## Takeaways

- Infrastructure-wise, the project is now genuinely multi-expert: `lightgbm`, `xgboost`, `catboost`, `lstm`, `transformer`, and `ensemble` all run through the same downstream `signal -> white_box_risk -> execution` chain.
- Signal quality does not translate linearly into executable return. Several experts show strong risk-layer returns but much weaker Alpaca-style execution returns once turnover, weight caps, and transaction costs are applied.
- On the aligned window, the current best single expert by execution return is **transformer**, while the current best ensemble is **ensemble_mean_score**.
- The aligned results support only a cautious research conclusion: on one aligned U.S. window, the system exhibits cross-domain signal behavior from A-share-trained models, but this is not yet enough to claim robust transferability.
- The current execution layer is still too lossy for these strategies to beat the internal same-window benchmark consistently.
- The next most valuable improvement is to add a **fixed external benchmark** such as `SPY buy-and-hold` or a fixed equal-weight U.S. pool benchmark, so future reports do not rely only on the internal same-window benchmark.
